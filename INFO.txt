uglify-js throws error when using "babel-preset-env" because the resulted input contains es6 stuff.
In order to work around this you can swap "babel-preset-env" with "es2015"
at the cost of polyfilling too much.

a. (when uglifyjs will support es6 input this config should be preferred)
{
  "plugins": [],
  "presets": [
    "react",
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "chrome": 55
      },
      "debug": true,
      "include": [],
      "exclude": [],
      "useBuiltIns": true,
      "modules": "commonjs"
    }]
  ]
}

b. (using this config until uglifyjs will support es6 input as "babili" (babel minifier) is not yet well tested)
{
  "plugins": [],
  "presets": [
    "react", "es2015"
  ]
}

2.
This code:
if ("production" !== process.env.NODE_ENV) {
    console.log('not production')
}
in production, is transformed by "envify purge --NODE_ENV production" into:
if ("production" !== "production") {
    console.log('not production')
}
which is further removed altogether by: "uglifyjs --compress=unused,dead_code"
